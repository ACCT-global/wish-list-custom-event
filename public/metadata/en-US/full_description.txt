## About

The Wishlist app is designed for **B2C**. It adds a heart icon to the Shelfs and Product Page, so the user can add it to the Wishlist, you can list all the Wishlisted items at `/wishlist`. 

## Configuration

Install this app from the VTEX APP Store

When the app is installed, a new route called `/wishlist` will be automatically created for your store, allowing the user to list all of their "Wishlisted" products.

:warning: This app provides the following blocks for use in the `store-theme`:

- `"add-to-list-btn"`: This block can be added to the product page (`store.product`) and shelf (`product-summary.shelf`). It renders a heart icon to the block.
- `"list-context.wishlist"`: This block provides a product list context that can be used to build a list of products.

If you want to make any changes to the `/wishlist` layout, feel free to change its blocks by creating a `wishlist.jsonc` file under `store/blocks` of your own theme.

Make sure to add the Wishlist app as a `peerDependency` in the `manifest.json` file:

```diff
 "peerDependencies": {
+  "vtex.wish-list": "1.x"
 }
```
