The Wishlist app is designed for **B2C**. It adds a heart icon to the Shelfs and Product Page, so the user can add it to the Wishlist, you can list all the Wishlisted items at `/wishlist`. This is the version `0` for the new VTEX IO platform, which means we'll add many other features and improvements in the further versions.

## Configuration

1. Add the `vtex.wish-list` app to your theme's dependencies in `manifest.json`. For example:

```diff
  dependencies: {
+   "vtex.wish-list": "0.x"
  }
```

Once Wishlist is added as a dependency, a new route called `/wishlist` will be automatically created for your store, allowing the user to list all the "Wishlisted" products. 

:warning: This app increment the standard VTEX shelf and product blocks with content using abstract interfaces from `vtex.wish-list` . The **VTEX wishlist block** is:

- `"add-to-list-btn"`: This block can be added to the product page (`store.product`) and shelf (`product-summary.shelf`). It renders a heart icon to the block.


## Modus Operandi

As said previously, after configured the user will be able to see a Heart icon to the shelf and product page, you'll also be able to access the Wishlisted items at `/wishlist`
